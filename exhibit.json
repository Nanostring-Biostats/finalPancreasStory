Most of the pancreas is exocrine tissue that produces enzymes to aid in digestion, including trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylases and lipases. The exocrine tissue consists of acinar cells (plural = acini) clustered around intercalated ducts. The endocrine tissue secretes hormones (primarily insulin and glucagon) into the bloodstream to regulate blood sugar levels. The endocrine tissue is organized into islets of Langerhans which contain glucagon-secreting alpha cells and insulin-secreting beta cells.\n\nThis pancreatic tissue was visualized with antibodies to insulin (beta cells), glucagon (alpha cells), PanCK (epithelial cells) and SYTO 83 (nuclei). In parallel, the sample was molecularly profiled with the GeoMx Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas (WTA) assay.\n\nThe square on the cartoon below represents the region analyzed in this study, and the corresponding tissue image is in the center panel.
